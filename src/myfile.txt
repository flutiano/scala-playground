The Latin (or, as it is also called, Roman) alphabet appeared in the 7th century BC as an adaptation of the Etruscan alphabet to the Latin language. The Etruscans themselves borrowed their alphabet from the Greek colonists in Italy; the origin of the Greek alphabet is traced through Phoenician scripts to the North Semitic alphabet, which was already in use in Syria and Palestine during the 12th c. BC.

There was a common spread opinion, shared even by some contemporary scholars, that the Latin characters were derived directly from the Greek ones. This hypothesis rested on the evident correspondence between the Latin alphabet and the Chalcidian variety of the western group of Greek scripts used at Cumae in Campania, southern Italy. It seems, anyway, inconsistent, because the name of the letters are clearly of Etruscan and not of Greek origin (a, be, ce, de etc. and not alpha, betha, gamma, delta etc.) and because of the specific representation in the most ancient documents of the [f] sound by the combination FH, which was peculiar to the Etruscan writing system.

The earliest inscription in Latin characters, dating from the 7th century BC, was made on golden brooch known as Praeneste Fibula (preserved now in the Museo Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini in Rome). It is written from right to left and reads
